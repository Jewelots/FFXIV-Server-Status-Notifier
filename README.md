FFXIV-Server-Status-Notifier
============================

A very small, portable, minimal-resource notification program that runs in the taskbar and alerts if an FFXIV server is online.

# Usage

Run the provided .exe (must be in the same folder as the provided .dll), the program will appear as a taskbar icon located near the clock.

Right click the icon to display three options; Settings, Running, and Exit.
 * "Settings" will allow you to modify which server you want to check the status of, and allow you to pick a preferable Check Delay.
 * "Running" is a checkbox that enables checking of server status. Server status checks will repeat based on Check Delay in settings.
 * "Exit" will completely shut down the program.
 
Note: Icon may move into hidden icons menu by default on windows. To fix this:
